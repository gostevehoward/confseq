# Builds the wheels (and source dist) for macOS on Python 3.7--3.10.
# This action is separated from the cibuildwheels-manylinux action because that cannot be parallelized while this is.
# Also, cibuildwheels makes building manylinux wheels much simpler, but macos wheels are straightforward to build via "python -m build".
